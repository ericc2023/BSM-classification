In this repository is the code used to create the results for the research paper.

In it, you will find a file to import data, a file to run random forest, and a file to run graph-based learning.

There are also two .csv files which contain the data outputted from the random forest and graph-based learning algorithms.

Finally, there is a file which creates a graph of the accuracies.
